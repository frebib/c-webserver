# Webserver in C

This small multi-client webserver is written as an assignment submission.
It can handle many concurrent connections and implements a basic subset of the [HTTP/1.1 standard according to RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)

It can be built and run with the following command:

```
make all run
```
